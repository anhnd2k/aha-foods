[Ghé fb của chúng tớ nhé](https://www.facebook.com/ngohoanganh.2k) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://www.facebook.com/ngohoanganh.2k).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

<!--
- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md` -->

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpeg)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
